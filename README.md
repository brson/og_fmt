# `og_fmt` â€” Will the real `format!` please stand up?

## **O.G. Rust Seriesâ„¢ â€” Rust as it really was**

### ðŸ’¯**%** **True Rust** &middot; Accept No Substitutes ðŸ’¯**%**

`og_fmt` brings back the legendary `fmt!` macro! [Removed from Rust in
2013](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/8637#issuecomment-23191833),
`fmt!` is a more primal interpretation of the Rust string formatting
paradigm. Some say that the renaming of `fmt!` to `format!` was the
single largest mistake in the history of Rust. We'll never know what
might have been, but we can still recapture a bit of that original
formatting feeling.

Behold! `fmt!`

### Example

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate og_fmt;

fn main() {
    let msg = fmt!("Original fmt! is the #{} fmt!", 1);
    println!("{}", msg);
}
```
